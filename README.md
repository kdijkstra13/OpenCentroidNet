# Getting started with OpenCentroidNet
CentroidNet is a hybrid convolutional neural network

1) run **create_dataset.py** to generate a synthetic dataset of your liking.
2) run **train.py** to train ad model using this generated dataset.
3) run **predict.py** to predict a single image in production.
4) adjust **config.py** to change hyper parameters.

# Generated data files and folders
## The input images and annotation data
**./data/dataset/** contains the image generated by **create_dataset.py** and the annotations in **train.csv** and **validation.csv**.\
Replace this data with your own set.

## Aerial Potato Dataset
The images of the original paper can be found in **./dataset/**

## The model
The weights of the CentroidNet model are stored in **./data/CentroidNet.pth**

## The input tensors to the model
**./data/validation_result/_inputs.npy** contains the normalized input tensor.\
**./data/validation_result/_targets.npy** contains the normalized target tensor.

## The output tensors of the model
**./data/validation_result/_vectors.npy** contains the normalized 2-d voting vectors (use this to see the quality of the training).\
**./data/validation_result/_votes.npy** contains the voting space (use this to tune Config.centroid_threshold and Config.nm-size).\
**./data/validation_result/_centroids.npy** contains a value of one for each centroid (final result).\
**./data/validation_result/_class_ids.npy** contains the class ids for every pixel.\
**./data/validation_result/_class_probs.npy** contains the class probability for every pixel.\
**./data/valitation_result/validation.txt** contains the final centroid coordinates and class info.
